This is the homepage of my Assignment 4 for section IT-304-DL3. To navigate through this website, click on the following menu buttons above.
The names of each menu item correspond to a different page.

- **Home** will take you to this page.
- **Ethics** will take you to a page regarding ethical concerns in Information Technology.
- **Citations** will take you to the list of sources used in creating this website.

The footer lists further information on the sample resources provided by the professor, along with what else I used in this work.
